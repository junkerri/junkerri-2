I don’t know when I started thinking of creating not as a project, or a goal, or a hobby—but as living.

Music, design, writing, code—it’s all language to me. Different tools to reach the same feeling. The same pulse.

I’ve never really wanted to choose just one thing. I want to learn everything. Maybe because I’ve had to. Maybe because I love it. Maybe both.

At some point I realized that learning new mediums—music production, web design, coding, visuals—wasn’t just a curiosity thing. It was about being able to make something without waiting for permission. About being independent. Self-sufficient. Not having to rely on anyone.

And yeah… part of that comes from a fear of being a burden. I’m still learning to ask for help. Still learning to let people in. Still unlearning the idea that I have to do it all myself to be worth anything.

But the truth is—every time I’ve let someone in, every time I’ve shared something unfinished or vulnerable—someone has shown up. With encouragement. With their own skills. With belief.

That’s what Pulse COOP is.

It’s a creative tech cooperative we co-founded to support each other, build things together, and strengthen our community. It’s not just about pooling skills—it’s about sharing the weight. Sharing the spark.

It’s a quiet refusal to believe that you have to go it alone to make something meaningful.

So yeah, I’m still learning new tools. Still jumping across mediums. Still trying to mix audio and code and color and memory into something that feels like me.

But I’m also learning to share the process. To collaborate. To rest.

To remember that independence doesn’t have to mean isolation.

And that asking for help can also be a form of creating.
