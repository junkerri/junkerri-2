I came to the U.S. in 2009 with one steady thing in my pocket: music.
Not a degree. Not a visa that promised stability. Just this one skill, this one passion that’s never really withered, no matter how much the rest of my life has shifted.

Since then, I’ve moved around more times than I can count. For college. For work. For love. For some blurry version of “the future.” Every city a new attempt. Every place a restart.

But the thing is: everywhere I’ve been, music has helped me make friends. It’s strange how that works. Not everyone in my life plays an instrument or writes songs, but almost everyone I’ve met—at least the ones who’ve stuck—came into my life because of music. I jammed with someone who introduced me to someone who introduced me to them. And somehow, that thread held.

There’s something about making sound together that shortcuts small talk. You don’t need to explain where you’re from or what you do or why you’re here. You just play. You listen. You laugh when something clicks or falls apart. That shared rhythm builds a kind of trust. A shortcut to connection.

Sometimes I think: everything else has changed—my jobs, my zip codes, my sense of home—but my need to create music hasn’t. It keeps pulling me forward. It keeps opening doors. It keeps me tethered to something that feels like me, no matter where I am.

It’s the one constant in all this movement.
The thread that never broke.
