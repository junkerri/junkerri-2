# 🔒 Security Setup - Environment Variables

## ✅ Security Issues Fixed

I've removed all sensitive information from your source code and moved it to environment variables:

### What Was Removed:

- ❌ Hardcoded Formspree form IDs (`mkgzeejy`, `mdkdjjgk`)
- ❌ Hardcoded email addresses
- ❌ Debug console.log statements exposing sensitive data

### What's Now Secure:

- ✅ Form IDs stored in environment variables
- ✅ Email addresses configurable via environment variables
- ✅ No sensitive data in source code

## 🔧 Setup Required

### Step 1: Create Your `.env` File

Create a `.env` file in your project root with your actual form IDs:

```bash
# Contact Form Configuration
CONTACT_EMAIL=junkerriart@gmail.com

# Formspree Configuration
FORMSPREE_CONTACT_FORM_ID=mkgzeejy
FORMSPREE_NEWSLETTER_FORM_ID=mdkdjjgk
```

### Step 2: Verify `.env` is Gitignored

Your `.gitignore` already includes:

```
.env
.env.production
```

This means your sensitive data won't be committed to git.

### Step 3: Test Your Forms

1. Restart your dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Test both forms to ensure they still work
3. Check that no sensitive data appears in your git status

## 🚀 Deployment Setup

### For Vercel:

1. Go to your Vercel project settings
2. Add these environment variables:
   - `FORMSPREE_CONTACT_FORM_ID` = `mkgzeejy`
   - `FORMSPREE_NEWSLETTER_FORM_ID` = `mdkdjjgk`
   - `CONTACT_EMAIL` = `junkerriart@gmail.com`

### For Other Platforms:

Add the same environment variables to your hosting platform's configuration.

## 🔍 Verification

Run this command to verify no sensitive data is in your code:

```bash
git status
```

You should NOT see any files with your form IDs or email addresses.

## ✅ Security Checklist

- [ ] `.env` file created with your form IDs
- [ ] `.env` file is in `.gitignore` (already done)
- [ ] No hardcoded form IDs in source code
- [ ] No hardcoded email addresses in source code
- [ ] Forms still work after changes
- [ ] Environment variables configured for deployment

Your forms are now secure and ready to commit! 🎉
